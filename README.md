This project aims to identify critical predictors of diabetes and explore the associations between the incidence of diabetes and certain dietary habits through a comprehensive data-driven
approach. Leveraging machine learning methodologies such as logistic regression , SVM(supervised learning techniques) and K-Means clustering (unsupervised learning techniques), the
data is first annotated to facilitate analysis. Then the correlation between important diseasepredictors to determine the most appropriate parameters is investigated. The results of the
analysis are considered, along with the consumption of various food types, to predict with a degree of certainty, whether an individual is likely to have diabetes or not using an SVM model.
This project could lead to enhanced predictive models to understand the interplay between health indicators and dietary patterns, leading to improved strategies for disease management and
prediction.
